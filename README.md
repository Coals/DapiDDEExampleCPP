# C++ Example For DDE Dapi in WorldsAway / VZones

This is a simple example of how the RAW Dapi Commands are sent to WorldsAway / VZones.

## Getting Started

Requirements:

* Visual Studio 2017 (Community Edition May Work)
* The VZones / WorldsAway Client [Download Link](https://www.vzones.com/downloads/) 
* VZones Account To Login [Signup Link](https://www.vzones.com/signup/)

Open the project in Visual Studio and Compile / Run

### Program / Source Code Purpose

This gives you a chance to see how the communication works between Windows and the WorldsAway client.

Most programs now that are developed for WorldsAway / VZones use what is known as vzdapi.dll or even the older wadapi.dll.

These c++ source files are 99% of what makes up wadapi.dll.
